Bless And Eat Front End

This is half of a two part front-end/back-end Application.

This website was created for a Single black female caterer who just started their own business.

The name of the company is called Bless And Eat. The owner is Lisa Coles.

The focus of the company is to bring soul food and a love for God together.

The app allows views to check out the menu, create an account, and if an account already existed sign in.
Currently, only mock orders can be placed.


****Future Development will include:
-The ability to place live orders
-The ability to be lead to a confirmation page aftet a successful order has been processed via Paypal.
-The ability to notify the Owner when orders have been placed.



To run this app(frontend):

- First, from the terminal, launch yarn start or npm start (See back-end set up first!)
{This is said, with the assumtion that you have yarn or node set up on your local device.}
-This will launch the server on localhost:3000


Enjoy!
